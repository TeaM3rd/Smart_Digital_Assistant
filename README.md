ABSTRACT:
The project “Smart Digital Assistant” is about generating data from several vehicles and store them in simple storage service(S3) and the data are fetched using lambda function and through interaction model alexa tells the data to the user when required.

Module splitup:
There are 3 modules

MODULE-1 (Durga Devi.S)
1.Data Collection.
2.Understanding data.
3.Cleaning data.
4.Interaction model.

MODULE-2 (Gracelin.S)
5.Data’s redirect to js code.
6.Integrating js code into Lambda fuction.

MODULE-3 (Akksaya Rajasri.G.P)
7.Connecting 
Lambda function and Alexa developers console
And test them.

PROPOSED SYSTEM:
Our proposed system reduces them by automating the whole complete process using a voice user interface (Amazon alexa echo dot) which will be much faster than the Existing system, also reduces the time and man power consumption. In our system user ask tank capacity through voice user interface (mic). User request sends to backend by connected endpoint, it will fetch the data from database and triggred to lambda. Lambda return information to the user.

ADVANTAGES:
	1.Minimal man power consumption.
	2.Minimal time consumption
  3.Computational errors and mistakes are minimized.
  
FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
1.Manual work has to be reduced.
2.Accuracy.
3.Result to be received very quickly.
4.To speed up the operation.

PROJECT COMPLETION STATUS:
 100% Project completed.
